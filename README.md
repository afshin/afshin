- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with this question: *Is **consciousness** computable by creating a complex software neural network or is it some different sort of phenomenon altogether?*
- âš¡ Fun fact: I no longer understand either the first human language or the first programming language I ever learned to read and write.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: `hello`@`darian.email`
- ðŸ¤– `beep boop beep...`
